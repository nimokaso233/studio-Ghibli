			<h2>Permanent exhibitions</h2>

			process of an animation filmmaker such as illustration techniques. Packed with books and toys, the room also displays 
			drawings and illustrations that cover the walls. Another exhibit demonstrates the process of creating an animated film,
			with sketches, storyboarding, keyframing, cleanup, coloring and background painting.</p>

			<h2>Straw Hat Café</h2>
			<p>The Straw Hat Café is the Ghibli Museum's only sit-down restaurant. It was created with the help of a housewife who is a mother 
			of four; Miyazaki wanted the café's food to be "a kind of home cooking". [21] The Café serves hot and cold foods, snacks, and desserts.
			 Sold at the takeout section is an original alcoholic beverage: "Valley of the Wind" beer. The beer was created by a collaboration with Dairy
			  Kingdom Oratche, a microbrewery in Tanna Basin. The beverage's label was hand drawn by Gorō Miyazaki, Hayao Miyazaki's son, who is an animation
			   director at Studio Ghibli as well</p>

			downsized from the original film scale as seen in My Neighbor Totoro</p>
