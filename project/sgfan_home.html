		<h1>Studio Ghibli</h1>
		<p><q><em>Studio Ghibli, Inc.</em> is best known for its anime feature films, and 
		has also produced several short films, television commercials, and one television film. 
		It was founded on 15 June 1985, after the success of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind 
		(1984), with funding by Tokuma Shoten.</q><br>

		<p> He directed several films with Ghibli, including Castle in the Sky in 1986, 
		<strong>My Neighbor Totoro</strong> in 1988, <strong>Kiki's Delivery Service</strong>
		in 1989, and <strong>Porco Rosso</strong> in 1992. The films were met with commercial 
		and critical success in Japan. Miyazaki's film <strong>Princess Mononoke</strong> was the
		first animated film to win the Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year, and 
		briefly became the highest-grossing film in Japan following its release in 1997;
		its distribution to the Western world greatly increased Ghibli's popularity and influence
		outside Japan. His 2001 film <strong>Spirited Away</strong> became the highest-grossing 
		film in Japanese history, winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th
		Academy Awards and considered among the greatest animation films of all time. Miyazaki's 
		later films—<strong>Howl's Moving Castle</strong>, <strong>Ponyo</strong>, and <strong>The Wind Rises</strong>
		—also enjoyed commercial and critical success. Following the release of <strong>The Wind Rises</strong>,
		Miyazaki announced his retirement from feature films. He returned to work on a new feature film
		in 2016.<br/>
